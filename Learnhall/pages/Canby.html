            <p class="text-p">
              Founded in 1857 and incorporated in 1893, Canby was named after General Edward Canby, a Civil War hero. Originally a hub for the Molalla and Clackamas tribes, the area became a fertile ground for settlers drawn to its rich farmland along the Willamette River. The city’s agricultural legacy endures, celebrated annually at the Clackamas County Fair, established in 1907, which draws thousands to its rodeos, livestock shows, and community events. Historic landmarks like the Canby Ferry, one of the last operational ferries in Oregon, and the downtown area’s quaint architecture reflect Canby’s pioneer spirit. Today, Canby balances its rural heritage with growth as a commuter-friendly suburb of Portland, fostering a nurturing environment for education. Our tutoring service supports this legacy by offering flexible, high-quality academic assistance to help Canby’s students thrive in a changing world.

            <h2 class="headings">The Educational Landscape of Canby</h2>
            <p class="text-p">
              Canby is served by the Canby School District (CSD), which enrolls approximately 4,140 students across seven schools: four elementary schools (Carus, Cecile Trost, Philander Lee, and William Knight), one middle school (Baker Prairie), one high school (Canby High), and one charter school (Ninety-One School), as of the 2024-2025 school year. CSD is known for its innovative programs, including dual-language immersion in Spanish and English at Baker Prairie Middle School, which supports the district’s 36% Hispanic student population. The district emphasizes personalized learning, with initiatives like AVID (Advancement Via Individual Determination) to prepare students for college and careers.
            </p>
            <p class="text-p">
              Canby High School, serving around 1,400 students, offers robust programs like Advanced Placement courses and CTE pathways in agriculture, business, and technology, aligning with Canby’s agricultural heritage and modern economy. According to the Oregon Department of Education’s 2024 At-A-Glance profiles, Canby High achieves a 92% on-time graduation rate, surpassing the state average of 86%. However, district-wide proficiency rates show 27% of students proficient in math and 42% in reading, compared to state averages of 31% and 44%, indicating opportunities for academic support. Baker Prairie Middle School, with 562 students, and Philander Lee Elementary, with 316 students, both rank in the bottom 50% of Oregon schools, with math proficiency at 25-29% and reading at 30-42%, highlighting the need for targeted interventions.
            </p>
            <p class="text-p">
              Canby’s private school options are limited but impactful. Schools like North Clackamas Christian School, located nearby, serve families seeking faith-based education, with small class sizes and a focus on college prep. Oregon’s private school enrollment has grown slightly, from 7% in 2019 to 7.5% in 2022, reflecting a trend toward alternative education. Canby families also benefit from proximity to private schools in Wilsonville and Oregon City, such as Victory Academy, which specializes in autism support.

            <p class="text-p">
              Our tutoring service supports students in Canby’s public and private schools, offering customized instruction for core subjects, advanced coursework, and standardized tests like the SAT, ACT, or Oregon state assessments. Whether your child attends Canby High or a private institution, our affordable, one-on-one tutoring—available in-person or online—ensures they achieve their academic potential.

            <h2 class="headings">Homeschooling in Canby: A Rising Choice</h2>
            <p>
              Homeschooling is a growing trend in Canby, reflecting Oregon’s strong homeschooling community. In the 2024-2025 school year, approximately 6.73% of U.S. students (3.7 million) are homeschooled, with Oregon reporting around 29,162 homeschooled students in 2021-2022, a 70% increase from pre-COVID levels. While specific Canby homeschooling data is unavailable, the Northwest Regional Education Service District, which serves Clackamas County, reports steady growth. Oregon’s homeschooling laws require parents to notify their local Education Service District within 10 days and administer state-approved tests in grades 3, 5, 8, and 10 after an 18-month grace period. Homeschooled students in Oregon score at the 71st to 80th percentile on standardized tests, 15-30 points higher than public school peers, according to the National Home Education Research Institute.
            </p>
            <p>
              The COVID-19 pandemic, which closed Oregon schools for 18 months, drove homeschooling rates to 9% in 2020, with many families continuing due to concerns about school environments (83%) and dissatisfaction with traditional instruction (41%). Canby’s homeschooling families benefit from resources like the Canby Public Library’s educational programs and regional co-ops, such as Village Home in Beaverton, offering classes and socialization. Microschools and online platforms provide additional support, particularly for students with special needs like dyslexia.
            </p>

              Our tutoring service is a vital partner for Canby’s homeschooling families, offering tailored support for any subject or exam, from foundational skills to college prep.
