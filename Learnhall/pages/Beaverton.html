            <p class="text-p">
              Beaverton’s roots trace back to 1847, when it was settled as a farming community named after the beaver dams along nearby creeks. Incorporated in 1893, the city grew with the arrival of the railroad, becoming a key hub for agriculture and trade. The historic Five Oaks, a landmark from the 1850s, symbolizes Beaverton’s early days. By the late 20th century, Beaverton transformed into a technology powerhouse, home to major corporations like Nike and Tektronix. Today, its diverse neighborhoods, from Central Beaverton to Bethany, reflect a blend of suburban charm and urban vitality. Our tutoring service complements this innovative spirit, offering flexible, high-quality academic support to help Beaverton’s students excel in a tech-driven world.

            <h2 class="headings">The Educational Landscape of Beaverton</h2>
            <p class="text-p">
              Beaverton is served by the Beaverton School District (BSD), the third-largest in Oregon, with over 39,000 students across 54 schools, including 34 elementary schools, nine middle schools, six high schools, five option schools, 19 option programs, and two charter schools, as of the 2024–2025 school year. BSD is renowned for its diversity, with 58% of students representing the global majority and families speaking 110 different languages. The district emphasizes Career Technical Education (CTE) with 33 programs, 12 dual-language schools, and specialized options like the International Baccalaureate at Southridge High School and arts-focused programs at the Arts and Communication Magnet Academy.
            </p>
            <p class="text-p">
              Top-performing schools like Bethany Elementary rank in the top 5% of Oregon schools, with 70–74% math proficiency and 75–79% reading proficiency, far surpassing state averages of 31% and 44%, respectively. However, district-wide, schools like Beaverton High report lower proficiency rates (17% math, 33% reading), highlighting areas where targeted support can make a difference. BSD’s graduation rate exceeds the state average, bolstered by a $723 million bond approved in 2022 to modernize facilities, ensuring state-of-the-art learning environments. Recent achievements include 14 seniors earning 2025 National Merit Scholarships, showcasing BSD’s commitment to excellence.
            </p>
            <p class="text-p">
              Beaverton’s private school sector is also robust, with institutions like Valley Catholic High School and Jesuit High School offering rigorous college-prep programs. Valley Catholic, part of the Sisters of St. Mary of Oregon campus, serves approximately 1,000 students from prekindergarten to 12th grade, emphasizing academic excellence and community service. Jesuit High School, with about 1,300 students, is nationally recognized for its STEM and humanities programs, with graduates attending top universities. Private school enrollment in Oregon has grown slightly, from 7% in 2019 to 7.5% in 2022, reflecting a trend toward alternative education options.
            </p>
            <p class="text-p">
              Our tutoring service supports students in both public and private schools, offering customized instruction for core subjects, advanced courses, and standardized tests like the SAT, ACT, or state assessments. Whether your child attends Westview High School or Valley Catholic, our affordable, one-on-one tutoring—available in-person or online—ensures they achieve their academic goals.

            <h2 class="headings">Homeschooling in Beaverton: A Growing Trend</h2>
            <p>
              Homeschooling is increasingly popular in Beaverton, mirroring Oregon’s vibrant homeschooling community. In the 2023–2024 school year, approximately 7.03% of Oregon’s K–12 students (about 39,000) were homeschooled, up from 6.53% the previous year. In the Portland metro area, including Beaverton, an estimated 22,000 students are homeschooled. The COVID-19 pandemic drove a 70% increase in homeschooling in 2020–2021, with many families continuing due to concerns about school environments (83%) and dissatisfaction with traditional instruction (72%). Homeschooled students in Oregon score 15–30 percentile points higher on standardized tests than public school peers, according to the National Home Education Research Institute.            
            </p>
            <p>
              Oregon’s homeschooling laws require parents to notify their local Education Service District within 10 days of starting homeschooling, with no mandated curriculum but required testing in certain grades after an 18-month grace period. Beaverton families benefit from resources like Village Home, a homeschooling community serving over 400 learners with grade-free, test-free classes in subjects from science to arts. Microschools, such as Activate in nearby Portland, cater to specialized needs like dyslexia, while the Oregon Home Education Network and Northwest Regional ESD provide support. Homeschooled students can also participate in public school extracurriculars, like sports, if they meet testing requirements.
            </p>

              Our tutoring service is a vital resource for Beaverton’s homeschooling families, offering tailored support for any subject or exam, from algebra to college prep.
